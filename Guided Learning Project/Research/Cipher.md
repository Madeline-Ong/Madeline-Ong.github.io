# Intro
As I started this project my Learning Facilitator asked me, what is a cipher and I realised I did not even know how to describe it. So I started my research on what a cipher is.

## History & Their Importance
The first cipher was created by Juilius Caesar in times of war where information needed to be kept secret so that even if the enemy got their hands on the message, they would not be able to understand it.
