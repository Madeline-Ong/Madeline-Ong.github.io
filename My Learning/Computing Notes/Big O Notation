n refers to the input size.

O(1) : Constant time complexity  == runtime is the  same, no matter the size of input
E.g. simple expressions/equations


O(log n) : Logarithmic time complexity == runtime grows logarithmically w input size
(log chart)


O(n) : Linear time complexity == runtime increase as same rate as input size (1:1)


O(n log n) : Linearithmic time complexity


O(n^2) : Quadratic time complexity == runtime dir proportionately w input size


O(2^n) : Exponential Time Complexity == runtime doubles for each input

O(n!) : Factorial Time Complexity
